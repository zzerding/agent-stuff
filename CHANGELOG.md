## Unreleased

* Forked from [mitsuhiko/agent-stuff](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff) and republished as `@zzerd/pi`.

* Removed the `btw` extension in favor of the independently maintained `@narumitw/pi-btw` package.
* Updated `trust-github-repos` to trust `zzerding` instead of `mitsuhiko`.
* Removed the `subagent` extension in favor of the installed [edxeth/pi-subagents](https://github.com/edxeth/pi-subagents) package.
